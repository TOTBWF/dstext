## Introduction

`dstext` is a small program that plays a mock dark souls death screen.

## Installation

Ensure that `sdl2_ttf`, `sdl_mixer`, and `sdl2_gfx` are all installed via
your systems package manager. Then, simply run:
```
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage
```
dstext "Program Used"
```

## Screenshots

Note that `dstext` does animate the text and also plays the classic
dark souls death sound, but I can't be bothered to try to upload
a movie to github for something I've already spent far too much time on.
